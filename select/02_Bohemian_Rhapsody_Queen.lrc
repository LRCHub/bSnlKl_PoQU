[00:00.06] Is this the real life?
[00:03.41] Is this just fantasy?
[00:06.97] Caught in a landside
[00:09.79] No escape from reality
[00:14.41] Open your eyes
[00:17.48] Look up to the skies and see
[00:31.48] 
[00:24.61] I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
[00:30.36] Because I'm easy come, easy go
[00:34.65] Little high, little low
[00:38.15] Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me (to me)
[01:07.15] 
[00:55.07] Mama
[00:57.98] Just killed a man
[01:01.34] Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger
[01:05.98] Now he's dead
[01:08.57] Mama, life had just begun
[01:15.08] But now I've gone and thrown it all away
[01:35.08] 
[01:22.24] Mama, oo-oo-oo
[01:28.63] Didn't mean to make you cry
[01:32.39] If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
[01:36.97] Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
[02:00.47] 
[01:54.23] Too late, my time has come
[02:00.58] Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
[02:08.03] Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
[02:14.46] Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
[02:36.96] 
[02:21.41] Mama, oo-oo-oo (the wind blows)
[02:28.38] I don't want to die
[02:31.73] I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
[02:53.23] 
[03:05.46] I see a little silhouetto of a man
[03:08.46] Scaramouch, Scaramouch, will you do the Fandango?
[03:32.96] 
[03:11.92] Thunderbolts and lightning, very, very frightening me
[03:15.69] Galileo, Galileo
[03:17.03] Galileo, Galileo
[03:18.53] Galileo, Figaro, magnifico, oh-oh-oh
[03:36.53] 
[03:22.28] I'm just a poor boy nobody loves me
[03:25.52] He's just a poor boy from a poor family
[03:28.44] Spare him his life from this monstrosity
[03:48.44] 
[03:33.35] Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
[03:36.34] Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
[03:39.39] (Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
[03:42.49] (Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
[04:05.99] 
[03:45.60] (Let me go) will not let you go
[03:47.16] (Let me go) never let you go
[03:48.56] (Let me go) (never) let you go (let me go)
[03:50.93] No, no, no, no, no, no, no
[04:03.93] 
[03:53.55] Oh, mama mia, mama mia (mama mia, let me go)
[03:56.84] Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me
[04:03.33] For me
[04:06.33] 
[04:14.57] So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye
[04:20.58] So you think you can love me and leave me to die
[04:25.40] Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby
[04:32.44] Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
[04:57.94] 
[04:54.60] Oo-oo
[04:59.57] Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
[05:08.57] 
[05:11.47] Nothing really matters, anyone can see
[05:18.27] Nothing really matters
[05:22.37] Nothing really matters to me
[05:36.37] 
[05:42.44] Any way the wind blows
