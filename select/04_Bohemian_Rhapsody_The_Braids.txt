Uh
Check it, check it
Yo
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life has just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, I didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
Kinda empty
That beat's kinda hot, yo
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
I'll carry on, nothing really matters
(I didn't mean to make you cry, if I'm not back again this time tomorrow)
(Carry on) Nothing really matters
No, I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
(Carry on) Nothing really matters
(Yeah)
Yo, hold up, hold up, hold up
So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this, baby
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
(Ooh)
(Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)
Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blows
