Mama, just killed a man,
Put a gun against his head,
Pulled my trigger now he's dead
Mama life had just begun,
But now i've gone and thrown it all away

Mama, ooooh
Didn't mean to make you cry
If i'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on, Cause nothin really matters

Too late,
My time has come,
Send shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody
I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth

Mama, oooh
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish i never been born at all

Oh oh carry on nothing really matters i didn't mean to make you cry
If i'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on, Cause nothin really matters

I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish i never been born at all, carry on
Nothing really matters

So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh, baby
Can't do this to me baby
Just gotta get out
Just gotta get right out of here

Oh, baby
Can't do this to me baby

Just gotta get right out of here

Oh oh carry on nothing really matters
I sometimes wish i never been born at all

Ooh carry on

Nothing really matters

Nothing really matters, anyone can feel.

Nothing really matters, to me

So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh, baby
Can't do this to me baby
Just gotta get out
Just gotta get right out of here

(Ooh yeah, ooh yeah)

Nothing really matters
Anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters
To me...
Any way the wind blows.
