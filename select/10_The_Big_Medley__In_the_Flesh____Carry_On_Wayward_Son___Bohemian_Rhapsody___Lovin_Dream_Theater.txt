- ("Uncovered" show at Ronnie Scott's jazz club, London - 1/31/95)
(From the "A Change Of Seasons" ep) i. "In The Flesh?"
- Roger Waters (Pink Floyd - from the album "The Wall")

So you thought you might like to,
Go to the show.
To feel the warm thrill of confusion,
That space cadet glow.
Tell me is something eluding you, sunshine?
Is this not what you expected to see?
If you wanna find out what's behind these cold eyes,
You'll just have to claw your way through this disguise.

Lights...
Roll the sound effects...
Action...

Ii. "Carry On Wayward Son"
- Kerry Livgren (Kansas - from the album "Leftoverture")

Iii. "Bohemian Rhapsody"
- Freddie Mercury (Queen - from the album "A Night At The Opera")

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye.
So you think you can love me and leave me to die.
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby,
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here.

Iv. "Lovin', Touchin', Squeezin'"
- Steve Perry (Journey - from the album "evolution")

You make me weep and wanna die
Just when you said we'd try
Lovin', touchin', squeezin'
Each other

When I'm alone all by myself
You're out with someone else
Lovin', touchin', squeezin'
Each other

You're tearing me apart
Every, every day
You're tearin' me apart
Oh, what can I say?
You're tearin' me apart
It won't be long, no, until
You're alone
When you're lover, oh he hasn't
Come home
'Cause he's lovin', oh he's touchin', he's squeezin'
Another

He's tearin' you apart
Every, every day
He's tearin' you apart
Oh girl what can you say?
'Cause he's lovin', touchin',
Another
Now it's your turn, girl, to cry

Vi. "Turn It On Again"
- Tony Banks, Phil Collins and Mike Rutherford
(Genesis - from the album "Duke")

Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on again
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on again

Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on again turn, turn it on, turn it on again
