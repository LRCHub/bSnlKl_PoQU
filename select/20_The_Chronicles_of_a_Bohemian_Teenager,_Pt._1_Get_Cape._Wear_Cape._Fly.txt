And I Was Stuck In Minor Chords, I'd Been Here Once Before.
With Environmental Echoes By Your Baggage On My Floor,
So Get Over Here, Let's Grab Ourselves Another Beer,
To Drink Until Tomorrow To Forget That We're Still Alive
We're Drinking To Forget And It Always Breeds Regrets,
And Disillusioned Faces Upon Friends That We've Seldom Met
I Do Believe That My Self Constructed Alibi,
Is Cracking Under Pressure Whilst I'm Breaking On The Inside
I'm Sick Of Making A Show,
I'm Sick Of Sitting With My Hands Trapped And Falling On My Back And
Telling People I Know, More Than They Needed To Know
And This Song Is More Than The Self Indulgent
Rant, Its Closure For The Times That I've Let You Down,
You Know I Need You Around
Well I'm Still Here, Long Overdue,
Because It Feels Like Home And A Life Of Pastures New
So This Ones For The Friends,
And Also For The Sounds,
Of Distant Laughter Righting Us,
Remind Us In A Town,
You Made Us Feel At Home,
We've Broken Backs On Floors Of Stone,
And Yet I'd Rather Wake There Any Day,
Than Wake Up Here Alone
Ba Da Ba Ba Ba
So This Ones For The Friends,
